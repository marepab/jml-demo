You can start and stop your runtime using ~/fabric-dev-servers/stopFabric.sh, and start it again with ~/fabric-dev-servers/startFabric.sh.

At the end of your development session, you run ~/fabric-dev-servers/stopFabric.sh and then ~/fabric-dev-servers/teardownFabric.sh. Note that if you've run the teardown script, the next time you start the runtime, you'll need to create a new PeerAdmin card just like you did on first time startup.
